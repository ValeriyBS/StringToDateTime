# Write a program which reads an ISO 8601 date and prints out the US & UK variants, and spoken form including month.


Examples
---------
2014-12-25 -> US: 12/25/2014 UK: 25/12/2014 Spoken: 25th of December 2014
2015-01-01 -> US: 01/01/2015 UK: 01/01/2015 Spoken: 1st of January 2015


The input string can be hardcoded.  You can assume the date is always valid.


The program should parse the input string and generate the relevant output string itself.  Use of the DateTime class is not allowed.
